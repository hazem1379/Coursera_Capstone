Description of the problem:
In a small city in Jordan called Irbid, there are about 500 Pharmacies spread all around the city, a new investor who is willing to open a new pharmacy in Irbid is looking for consultation about where is the best place that can he start his pharmacy. so he is looking for a data analysis to study the neighborhoods in the city. The investor wants a commercial area which has many attractive sites that bring many walking people, and he means by attractive site, places like restaurants museums, coffee shops and other attracting places.
So the analysis should answer the following questions:
1- Which area has the highest number of attractive areas like coffee shops etc…
2- How many pharmacists are already open in the most attractive neighborhood?
3- What is the recommended areas that can be chosen to open the new Pharmacy?
The main assumption behind this study is that in order to increase the chances of success of opening a commercial private pharmacy in the city in Irbid, the investor should choose a location with less competition and with many people visiting that location because of the attractive sites in that are based on that same location or neighborhood.
